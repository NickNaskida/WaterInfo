## Inspiration

## What it does
WaterMeter is a system that provides client an ability to define a drinking water source/lack location with detailed description. All these locations are added to the database and are visualised on interactive maps with detailed information.

## How we built it
First of all, it started with finding a tool that could visualise data on map. After google searching for a while, we ran into a tool for python called "Folium" that could handle interactive map visualization with markers, area definitons and etc.

Secondly, we chose a framework to handle all the templates and backend stuff. We ended up chosing Flask, because of its straitforward architecture and also, due to the reason that Folium had an example of integration with Flask.

Finally,

## Challenges we ran into
During development and brainstorming we ran into many complec challenges that needed a solution and answer.

- Data gathering from clients (input forms and etc.)
- Data visualization on map
- General idea of the app (How to define water lack and source locations, etc.)
